# OpenPolandballRoleplay

![Game Logo](OpenPolandballRoleplayClient/src/texture/PBRP.png)

A multiplayer social game inspired by Club Penguin, but with Countryballs! Built with Godot Engine.

Polandball Roleplay (PBRP) was originally a closed-source ROBLOX game found 3.14.2015. 

It was prone to drama and mismanagement, therefore it fell in early 2020.

The idea to create the off ROBLOX variety of PBRP was first realized in mid 2020, with work on it beginning in late 2021.
Several prototypes such as Polandball Chat were made, but never released. Footage of it should easily be found on the internet.

This version seeks to become a free and open-source alternative of traditional PBRP made by its own creator (salih1, known as salihkes on GitHub).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Important Notes

- **Code Structure**
  - Current codebase is undergoing restructuring
  - Development history:
    - 2021: Original version in GDScript
    - 2022: Rewritten in C#
    - 2023: Translated back to GDScript
    - 2024: Simplified (pending proper restructuring)
  - A formal code convention will be implemented soon

- **Map System**
  - Default map is a basic baseplate
  - Custom maps must be provided as .pck files
  - Map configuration:
    1. Place .pck file in user:// directory
       - macOS: `/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/OpenPBRP`
    2. Modify "mapload" in s1sd.gd to reference your map file
    3. Map structure must follow:
       - `res://DynamicMaps/[map_name]/Main.tscn`
       - `[map_name]` must match .pck filename (no spaces/special chars)

The previus versions allowed dynamic map loading via a graphical UI, but it was removed temporarily for ease of use and ease of development.

### Prerequisites
- Godot Engine 3.x
- Python 3.8+ (for server. Miniconda installation recommended.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/salihkes/OpenPolandballRoleplay.git
```

2. Set up the server:
```bash
cd OpenPolandballRoleplayServer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure SSL:
   - Place your SSL certificate as `cert1.crt`
   - Place your SSL key as `key1.key`

4. Configure the server:
   - Create the 'flags' and 'users' folders.
   - Set admin usernames in `admins` list
   - Configure invite codes if using registration
   - Adjust WebSocket port (default: 8765) and modify the URL in `connecttoserver()` in `game.gd` (the default URL points to wss://yourdomain.com:8765).

### Flag System
The server expects country flags in TGA format in the `flags` folder:
- Format: `countryname.TGA`
- Flags are automatically converted to PNG for clients
- Flags are not included in the repository
- Server owners need to provide their own flag images

### Map System
Maps are stored in two formats:
- `.json` files for map data
- `.pck` files for Godot resource packs

### Security Features
- Password hashing with unique salts
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Temporary and permanent ban systems
- Admin commands for moderation

### Admin Commands
```text
!tempban [username] - Temporarily ban a user (1 hour)
!permban [username] [reason] - Permanently ban a user
```
